# IMAGE-STEGANOGRAPHY

## Steganography: Concealing a message or data within another file in a way that it cannot be detected easily.

## Image Steganography: Concealing data within an image file without affecting its appearance.

## Image Steganography
# Overview
Steganography is the practice of concealing a message or data within another file in such a way that it is not easily detectable. Image steganography specifically involves embedding data within an image file without visibly altering its appearance.

# Purpose
The purpose of this script is to demonstrate image steganography techniques using Python, allowing users to hide and retrieve data within image files seamlessly.

# Features
Hide Data: Embeds data (text, binary, or other formats) into an image.
Retrieve Data: Extracts hidden data from a steganographically modified image.
Minimal Impact: Ensures that the hidden data does not visibly alter the original image.

# Usage
1.Installation:

Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
Install required libraries using pip
pip install pillow

2.Running the Script:
Run the script with Python
python steganography.py
Follow the prompts to select an image file, choose to hide or retrieve data, and input necessary data or retrieve hidden data.

3. Example:
Select an image file (example.png).
Hide a message within the image or retrieve previously hidden data.
Save the modified image with hidden data or display the extracted hidden data.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
pillow library (Python Imaging Library, forked as Pillow)
# Notes
This script provides a basic implementation of image steganography 
Ensure that the image file format supports lossless compression (e.g., PNG, BMP) for optimal results.
Embedding larger amounts of data may affect the quality of the image or increase file size.
